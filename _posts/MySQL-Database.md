# MySQL Database

For a school project, I created a database utilizing MySQL. A user can register an account that holds the user's email, password & data depending on the game. In this case, in this space shooter, the user can upgrade their ship. The upgrade increases the ship's damage, health & speed.

I run the server on EasyPHP Devserver 17.0 & handle MySQL on phpMyAdmin.
