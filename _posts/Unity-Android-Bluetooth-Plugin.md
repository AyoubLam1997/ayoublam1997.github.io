# Unity Android Bluetooth plugin

During my internship at the dutch military, I created a Android Bluetooth plugin for Unity. With this plugin, you can see what Android Bluetooth devices are in your area, pair with them and create a peer-to-peer connection with one of the devices act as a server.

Below is a video demonstrating a chat system between 2 android phones, where one is hosting the connection.
