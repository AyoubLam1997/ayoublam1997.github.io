# GMTK ’21 Jam: Souls Reflection

I joined the Game Maker ToolKit 2021 gamejam with a group of friends and created a game within 2 days! The game we created is Souls Reflection.

Souls Reflection is a 2D Action Puzzle game about working together with your friend to solve puzzles, battle through monsters and to find a way out!

I worked on the following:
- Projectile collision detection
- Enviromental art
- Prop art
